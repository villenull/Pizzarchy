# deck-session.sh -- two-way Gaming Mode <-> Desktop Mode session switching
# for a Steam Deck running Omarchy. T3's session layer.
#
# ===========================================================================
# WHAT UPSTREAM ALREADY DOES -- verified by reading what the installed
# packages actually ship (jupiter-staging/gamescope 3.16.25-3, Valve's build).
# ===========================================================================
#
# Valve's gamescope package already ships the ENTIRE SteamOS Gaming Mode
# session. This is worth stating because PLAN.md 6.4 says to fork
# 28allday/Super-Shift-S-Omarchy-Deck-Mode "because it solves the hard part",
# and that is no longer true:
#
#   /usr/share/wayland-sessions/gamescope-wayland.desktop  the session entry
#   /usr/bin/start-gamescope-session                       the entry point
#   /usr/lib/steamos/gamescope-session                     the real launcher
#   /usr/lib/systemd/user/gamescope-session.target         the unit graph
#   ... plus steam-launcher, ibus-gamescope, steam-notif-daemon,
#       gamescope-mangoapp and galileo-mura-setup (OLED mura correction).
#
# The closest prior art (28allday/deckshift) pulls ChimeraOS's
# gamescope-session from the AUR to get this -- necessarily, because DeckShift
# targets generic PCs with no access to Valve's repos. On Deck hardware with
# jupiter-staging configured, none of that is needed. DeckShift is also
# unlicensed, so this project cannot ship or vendor it at all.
#
# So this script does NOT build a session and does NOT fork one. It supplies
# the one thing Valve does not ship outside SteamOS: the mechanism for
# switching between that session and the Omarchy desktop, in both directions.
#
# ===========================================================================
# THE GAP THIS CLOSES
# ===========================================================================
#
# Steam's "Power -> Switch to Desktop" in Gaming Mode shells out to
# `steamos-session-select desktop`. That binary lives in SteamOS's
# steamos-customizations and is in NO repo configured here (verified with
# `pacman -F` against core/extra/multilib/omarchy/jupiter-staging/
# holo-staging). Without it, Steam's own affordance silently does nothing --
# which is PLAN.md 8.1's failure mode, in the one place a controller-only
# user has no way to work around.
#
# So: install a `steamos-session-select` that behaves the way Steam expects,
# plus a matching path back from the desktop.
#
# ===========================================================================
# SECURITY TRADEOFF -- read before extending
# ===========================================================================
#
# Switching sessions means restarting the display manager, which is root-only.
# Steam invokes the hook as the unprivileged desktop user, so something has to
# bridge that.
#
# This uses a sudoers drop-in granting NOPASSWD on exactly one absolute path
# (${SELECT_BIN}) and nothing else. That is a real privilege grant and is
# deliberately narrow: the target is root-owned 0755, so a user who could
# rewrite it would already need root. The drop-in is validated with
# `visudo -c` before installation -- a malformed sudoers file breaks sudo
# for every user on the machine, so it is never written unvalidated.
#
# polkit would be the more conventional mechanism. It is not used here
# because the action would still amount to "this user may restart the display
# manager", and a sudoers line saying exactly that is far easier to audit
# than a polkit rule plus a helper. Revisit if this ships as a package.
